# Development

### Link to Deployed Website

https://trustyturtle21.github.io/Real/

### Goal and Value of the Application

the goal of the application is to browse anime through the sorting and filter options and be able to keep track of the anime that you have watched by adding to watchlist through the "Add to WatchList!" button

### Usability Principles Considered

My application should be able to handle any combination of filters, and all filters and sorting methods should work together without breaking the page

After Filtering there is an â€œAll" catagory to unfilter

After Sorting, there is an unsort Button

After adding to your watch list, there is a reset watch list button

### Organization of Components

AnimeCard is a component for each anime

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

Data is passed down through components since there is a mapping function that goes through the json list and also passing in props, that is used to alter the current states

### How the User Triggers State Changes

The user triggers state changes by the clickable links and buttons
States include
totalWatchTime
names
genre
season
data
